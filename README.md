# AGRICULTURAL-PRODUCTIVITY-OPTIMIZATION-ENGINE

## Overview

The Agricultural Productivity Optimization Engine is a machine learning-based tool designed to help farmers and agricultural experts optimize crop yields. By analyzing environmental conditions, soil data, and historical crop performance, this engine provides data-driven recommendations to improve agricultural productivity.

## Features

1) Data Analysis: Processes and analyzes data related to soil health, weather conditions, and crop characteristics.
2) Modeling: Utilizes predictive models to estimate crop yield based on current and forecasted environmental factors.
3) Optimization: Suggests optimal planting times, fertilizer usage, and irrigation schedules.
4) User Interface: Provides an easy-to-use interface for farmers to input their data and receive actionable insights.

Dataset

The dataset consists of:

1) Soil Data: Contains metrics like soil pH, moisture content, and nutrient levels.
2) Crop Data: Includes historical data on crop yields, planting schedules, and environmental conditions.
3) Weather Data: Provides weather forecasts and historical conditions relevant to crop growth.
4) Ensure that the data is formatted correctly in CSV files before running the scripts.

Models Used

1) Decision Trees
2) Random Forests
3) Gradient Boosting

These models are trained to predict optimal conditions for planting and other agricultural activities based on the input data.
